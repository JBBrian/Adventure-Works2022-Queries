# PROJECT OVERVIEW
Using Microsofts real world sample database, Adventure Works, to practice using advance SQL. The Adventure Works database is based on a fictional company that manufactures and distributes bikes, bike accessories and bike parts. The database contains over 70 tables.

# RESEARCH QUESTIONS
- What is the average employee retention rate per position?
- What is our profit margin for each product?
- What is the highest selling product per category?
- What is each employees tenure?

Above I have listed just some of the research questions I asked myself and proceeded to answer by querying the database. The code provided [here](https://github.com/JBBrian/Adventure-Works2022-Queries/blob/a3f31ffeebd3dc342e03e38d2c4825c823a5306d/Adventure%20Works%20Queries.sql) details all the research questions and every query developed. 

Still developing more queries but uploading the project to show progression üëç
